# Welcome to my [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver (V3)!

## How to use:

- You first be shown a list of all possible words
- You will then be given a 'best guess' word to cut down this list
- Some of the words in this list aren't valid in wordle. So there is a y/n prompt for if a word is valid.
