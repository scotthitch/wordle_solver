## Use:

_Note: The aim of the reccomended words is to cut down the list of possible words as quickly as possible. \
The reccomended word will not be the final answer. \
The final answer will be displayed in the list of possible words._

- You'll first be shown a list of all possible words
- You will then be given a 'best guess' word to cut down this list
- Input this word into Wordle and check the results
- Input the 5 results as follows (e.g. 'nymmn'):
  - y: yes (a green letter)
  - n: no (a grey letter)
  - m: maybe (a yellow letter)
- Keep going with these reccomendations until the 'possible words' list is small
- Enter your final answer from the 'possible words' list
