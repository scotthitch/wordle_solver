# Welcome to my [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) solver! (v3)

## How to use:

- You first be shown a list of all possible words
- You will then be given a 'best guess' word to cut down this list
- Some of the words in this list aren't valid in wordle. So there is a y/n prompt for if a word is valid
- Once you've found a valid word, input the 5 results as follows (e.g. 'nymmn'):
  - y: yes. (a green letter)
  - n: no (a grey letter)
  - m: maybe. (a yellow letter)
